# Programmable thermostat from Telegram

## Versione 3.0
In this third version I added input_text to view the activated mode (AUTO, MANUAL, AWAY) and I fixed the lovelace UI:

## Versione 2.0
In this second version I added two operating modes:

![Lovelace](https://i.imgur.com/FcgOm4I.jpg)

- AWAY Mode (I am away from home and the reference temperature is set at 17Â° C, therefore as if it were manual, but with a different setPoint temperature. This temperature can be changed in the automation code)
- TurnOFF (I turn everything off, from climate to automation)

The package has been updated as well as the part of the telegram buttons and finally the lovelace part.

In detail.
An _input_boolean.away_mode_ has been added, which defines or not the away mode
In the first version, a history_stats sensor was introduced, referring to the period of heating of the radiators in the last 24 hours, namely _yesterday_.
Thus, from this sensor, the template was created, readable on a human level indicating _hh:mm:ss_.

With the update, another history_stats sensor has been added for a personal need.
This time the count is from midnight of the current day until the moment I request this value, _00:00-now_, so to speak!
This also has its own template below, for a human level.

The _uptime sensor_ and the two _binary_sensor_ used to know the cloud or MQTT mode of the **Shelly1** have been left unchanged, a device used as a clean contact for ignition and burial of the boiler.

## Version 1.0
The idea starts here (https://ledstripsandcode.blogspot.com/2018/11/simple-thermostat-scheduler-in-home.html), and then develops according to my needs.

I needed an hourly and daily / weekly program to manage the home heating, in addition to the simpler function of the thermostat (the boiler switches on below a certain temperature threshold).
In the specific of the program from Monday to Friday rather fixed times, fixed and the weekend, instead, two alternatives:

- radiators always off, since we are not at home
- always heated radiators, since we are always at home

So I thought of managing everything through two modes, **AUTO** and **MANUAL**.
- With **AUTO** there is an already preset scheduler (python script) where there are three programs:
  * the weekly one from Monday to Friday
  * that of the weekend when we are not at home
  * that of the weekend in which we are always present

- With **MANUAL**, on the other hand, the boiler switches on when the temperature drops below a setpoint temperature.

Finally, just for completeness, everything is managed remotely through the telegram "buttons", this because I have a 4G connection and as DuckDNS does not work in 4G.
So the only alternative to all this is Telegram!
